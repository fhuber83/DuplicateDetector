# TODO and Wishlist

## Functionality
- Offer more options for opening files
	- Image viewer
	- Audio player
	- PDF viewer
	- ...

## UI
- Show summary of duplicate files and their size
- Hide Hash? Make Optional??
- When deleting files, update size info
- When deleting all duplicates (count==1), remove that item from the main view
- When multiple files are selected, deleting from the context menu should delete all selected

## Internal
- Add a million null checks (sigh)
- Make DiffPDF portable (again)
